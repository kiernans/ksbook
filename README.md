# KSBook

A browser based code editor and notebook that exports all work into a local file. The project has been uploaded to
[NPMjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Quick Start

### In your terminal, run the following command to run the program from NPM:

```bash
    npx ksnote serve -p (PORT NUMBER defaults to 4005) (FILENAME defaults to notebook.js)
```

You will then be prompted to click on the link provided within the terminal. All work typed into the code editor and notebook
will be exported into a file called notebook.js (or whatever filename was indicated) within the local directory the command was ran from.
